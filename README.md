# Reggie-s-Linear-Regression
In this project we have combined knowledge of lists, loops, and syntax to perform some calculations on  data.
_Linear Regression_ is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points. A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the _error_, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of _best fit_.

We will use loops, lists, and arithmetic to create a function that will find a line of best fit when given a set of data.
Here we are developing an model that predicts the bounce height of the different balls.
